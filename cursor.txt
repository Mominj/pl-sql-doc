Cursor :
Cursor in SQL
To execute SQL statements, a work area is used by the Oracle engine for its internal processing and 
storing the information. This work area is private to SQL’s operations. 
The ‘Cursor’ is the PL/SQL construct that allows the user to name the work area and access the stored information in it.


cursor is a pointer to a memory area called context area.
This area is a memory region inside the process global area(pga) assigned 
to hold the information about the processing of a select statement or dml statement.

This area is a memory region inside pga which helps oracle server in processing an
sql statement by holding the important information about that statement. 
 --> rows returned by a query
 --> Number of rows processed by a query
 --> A pointer to the parsed query in the share pool

Using cursor we can control the context area as it is a pointer to the same.

type of cursor :
 --> emplicit Cursor : Automatically created by the oracle server. User can not control the 
                       behavior of these cursors. Oracle server creats an 
                       implicit cursor for any pl/sql blocks which executes and
		       sql statement.
    
 --> explicit cursor: as long as  explicit cursor that not exit fot that 
		       sql statement.
		    -Explicit cursor are user define cursor.
                    -user has full control
 
         steps of creating explicit cursor
